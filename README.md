# GenerativeMTD: A deep synthetic data generation framework for small datasets

# # Overview
- Deep learning-based synthetic data generation frameworks for small tabular data are limited
- GenerativeMTD provides a deep learning-based framework for synthetic data generation from small datasets
- GenerativeMTD uses pseudo-real data instead of the real dataset itself for training the deep learning model
- The pseudo-real data is translated into synthetic data that is statistically similar to the real data
- Synthetic data generated by GenerativeMTD is statistical similarity and privacy-preserving in terms of pairwise correlation difference and nearest neighbor distance ratio

The following illustration shows how the algorithm generates artificial samples. For more information, refer the original [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2023.110956).

## Usage 
```python3
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from GenerativeMTD import *
from utils import *
from gvae_data_transformer import *
from preprocess import find_cateorical_columns, match_dtypes

# Generate samples for unsupervised learning task
real = pd.read_csv('Data/wisconsin_breast.csv')
cat_col = find_cateorical_columns(real)
model = GenerativeMTD(real)
model.fit(df,discrete_columns = cat_col)
fake = model.sample(1000)
fake = digitize_data(df,fake)
```
